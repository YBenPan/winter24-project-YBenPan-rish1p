## Tasks, member responsibilities
Each team member should be responsible for a clearly identifiable part of the project.

Ben - focus on trade execution, graphics
## Schedule, midpoint milestones
Our midpoint is focusing on getting the exchange and terminal set up on the Pi. We will try to get the internet access working for the second part of this!
