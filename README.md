## Self-evaluation
How well was your team able to execute on the plan in your proposal?  
- We successfully followed the plan in our proposal. We felt networking was too ambitious and we know we won't have enough time to figure it out, so it was a wise decision.

Any trying or heroic moments you would like to share? Of what are you particularly proud:
the effort you put into it? the end product? the process you followed?
what you learned along the way? Tell us about it!
- Heroic moments: cramming the last part (connecting the Pi) the night before at Gates Basement
- Proud of: creating a good plan and following through. Modified the plan as new issues popped up (implement floating point for printf)
